        <td> It's 2020 and the Coronavirus has swept the globe. No one saw it coming. Or was it actually
          foretold? Doesn't matter because it's here. What do we do now? Here are some ways to survive the pandemic.</td>

  <h3>1. Wear a mask</h3>

      <td>COVID-19, or as it is colloquically called La Rona, is spread through
          the respiratory system and lives in the lungs. It can get to your lungs the same way any other type of
          air goes into your lungs. So how can we stop the intruder formely known as 2019-nCoV? No, we can't hold our breath until it's all over. You got, it a üò∑.
          <p>Hide ya mouth, hide ya nose because it is getting in everything out here.</p></td>

      <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Wearing a mask can help to quell the spread of La Rona. If everyone wears one, we all get to not spread our COVID germs to
                others and we get to keep our hot breath to ourselves. That sounds like a win-win. Not convinced? This graphic provides a
                pretty logical explanation for all those naysayers.
              <p>If you're still not swayed, then I'm conviced you are the pee-perpetrator in the picture. Gross ü§¢.</p>

  <h3>2. Social Distancing</h3>
  <p>Newton's First Law of Motion: "Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change
        that state by forces impressed on it</p>
        <p>
          Basically if we keep the Virus-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in motion, homeboy will stay in motion until it's acted on by some other force. Maybe that force
          is a mask or maybe its the Force "that resides in all life forms and binds the galaxy together." The point is, it needs to be stopped. Staying six
          feet apart can help because word on the street is Covfefe-19 has no bunnies without some help from the wind. Stay upwind <strong>(always sage advice)</strong>
          and away from those not from your household.
        </p>
  <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <p>Now if you are ones of those people who absolutely can't stay away from others, please don't act as if binging on Netflix or any other streaming site hasn't be an excuse once or twice to avoid humanity. Catch up on some documentaries and <a href="https://youmatter.world/en/best-top-new-documentaries-netflix-sustainability-ecology/">slow climate change</a>.

  <h3>3. Check in with loved ones, neighbors and maybe strangers</h3>

      <td> <p>Also remember, these are some really hard times. While some can say the pandemic hasn't altered too much of their daily lives, for others it has been down right earth-shattering. Check to
        see if someone can use a helping hand or some groceries. Maybe a phone call or a Zoom Game Night. Maybe some people just need a, "Hey! Just want you to know you crossed
        my mind. Hope everything's good [enough]."</p>

        <p>We're apart so we can survive and that isn't easy. The point is that we reach the other side of this (however that may look) safe, healthy and sane.</p></td>
